The Python File Format Interface aims to make it easy to manipulate binary files in a Python environment. Starting from a file format description written in XML, PyFFI creates customizable Python classes to read and write file blocks as described by the XML. Currently, PyFFI supports the NetImmerse/Gamebryo NIF and KFM formats, FaceGen's EGM and TRI formats, CryTek's CGF format, the DDS format, and the TGA format. Many tools for files used by 3D games, such as a stripifier, and a tangent space calculator, are included in PyFFI as well.

QSkope is PyFFI's graphical user interface, and enables simple editing of files in any file format supported by PyFFI.
